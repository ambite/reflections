Reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share my code/files with others. To have a remote backup that I can access 
    from any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To check whether changes made by others in the remote repository do not conflict with
    my local development copy and be able to fix such conflicts.
