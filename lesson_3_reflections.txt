Setting up the remote github repository

# Set git to use the osxkeychain credential helper
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

git remote add origin https://github.com/ambite/reflections.git

git remote -v

# to send all the commits in the master brach to the remote repository (called origin by convention)
git push origin master

# to get the changes done in github by self or by other contributor into the local repository
git pull origin master

# to copy a forked repository into my local machine
git clone https://github.com/ambite/recipes.git

# no need to set up a remote in github when forking. It's done automatically.
ambite (master) recipes $ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/ambite/recipes.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/ambite/recipes.git (push)

# To set up collaborators in github go to settings

Reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share my code/files with others. To have a remote backup that I can access 
    from any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To check whether changes made by others in the remote repository do not conflict with
    my local development copy and be able to fix such conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of somebody else's repository done at github. It
    credits the original creator. A clone is copy of another
    repository, generally a local copy of a remote github
    repository. After doing a fork, usually one clones the fork to the
    local machine to work on it (rather than on github). A branch is a
    different line of development for some code. It helps to explore
    alternatives. Branches can be merged into other branches. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
