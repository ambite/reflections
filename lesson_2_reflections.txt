What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

     Git creates a directory .git to hold the metatada about the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you  think it offers?

    The staging area holds the files that need to be tracked by the repository, before we decide to commit them. The working directory just holds all the files in that directory. The advantage of the staging area is that we can add a subset of the files of the working directory (i.e., only track a subset), as well as add more files or remove them from tracking.
